### :ledger: Story Template
This Unity template is used for story-based games, i.e puzzle games, horror, and narrated games. There are invoked events and a script for picking up and inspecting assets.
Should be used as a tool to help build prototypes faster and more efficiently and not publish-ready games.

C++ Templates soon (mostly focusing on unity templates right now, combat and fps next)
